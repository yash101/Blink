# Blink
Don't forget to blink!

## Intro

Sitting in front of your computer too much? Eyes dry and irritated? Blink'll help you out! ðŸ˜€

Blink works by (annoyingly) reminding you to take a break and blink. When we are focused on our computers for too long, we tend to forget to _blink_. This causes the cornea to dry up and cause eye irritation.

Blink's popup will show when you are not blinking enough. It will automatically disappear when you blink.

Blink is built in a client-server architecture, so you can use a different computer (such as a raspberry pi) as the camera, reducing battery drain on your system.

Likely will have cloud integration :).
